# WindowsLockScreenScraper

-	Install python 3 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
-	Once finished, open Windows Command Prompt, type 'python --version' to verify the installation. If this command is successful then python is installed. 
-	Once verified, type 'pip install ImageHash' and wait for the installation process to finish.

- Extract everything into a folder, your Pictures\ImageScraper folder is probably best, and after following the instructions above double click on ImageScraper.bat and follow its prompts. It will automatically pull all the unformatted image files, ask you for permission to reformat all files in the specified folder (\Wallpapers\) and then reformat, check for duplicates, and delete images as needed.
